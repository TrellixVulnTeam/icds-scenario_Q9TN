Data Viz Scenario for ICDS

# Visualizations â€“ scrollytelling site

## Actual cluster data

### Charts with national data

Stacked bars by age or connected scatter plot (multi-series)?

### Data driven circles map

Circle size by number of individuals in the cluster
Change color by rate of seroprevalence
Slider to filter by age
Pop-up with same stacked bars as above
Geocoder search to zoom to location

## Predict outcomes for an individual

Our first attempt to generalize the clusters across a wider area

### Voronoi

Cut up country into slices by cluster
Bivariate choropleth, or same colors as circles map?
Slider to filter by age
Pop-up with same chart(s) as above
Geocoder search to zoom to location

### Gridded pop. data coded by voronoi cluster

TK - more info needed here

## Targeting vaccination campaigns

Assume that age does not affect susceptibility differently by location

### Choropleth by political boundaries

Calculate cluster data stats by population within political boundaries
Slider to filter by age
Pop-up with same chart(s) as above
Geocoder search to zoom to location
